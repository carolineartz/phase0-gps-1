## GPS 1.1 Reflections by
### By Ryan Lesson
**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**<br>
Fethching data from a repository on github and merging it with your master branch locally. Also, I wasn't entirely sure about the process of how pull requests should work, after the GPS I know fully understand the conecpt.<br>
**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**<br>
The process of how pull request was definetly clarified for me
**What Questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**<br>
A lot of questions lol. More specifically I asked about pull request, fetching data from a github repositoy, and tags in markdown.
**What still confuses you about git?**<br>
I believe that I have a pretty good grasp of git currently. Wouldn't be surprised if that were to change when we start learning new material. Nevertheless I am excited for the challenge. Also, I dont know why sublime won't open in my terminal. I must of set it as my default text edittor incorrectly. Will seach out for answers<br>
**How was your first expirence of pairing in a GPS?**<br>
It was very insightful and enjoyable. My partner was a pleasure to work with. The instructer was very helpful and gave out help when need appropriatly. I feel that I learned a lot form pairing with her!
